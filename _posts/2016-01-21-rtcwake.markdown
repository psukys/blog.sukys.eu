As my cell phone is keen on not getting me up in the mornings due to various reasons, I longed for something that would fix this problem. *Jurgis Did - Do You Own Your Demons* was the motivation behind DIY attempt at doing this.

The whole project revolves around RTC (real time clock) based program called `rtcwake`.
My script suspends, *wakes up* at specific time and plays the song.
Also, due to quality sleep concerns I've used [sleepyti.me](sleepyti.me)'s algorithm to calculate best wake up time based on REM (rapid eye movement - deep sleep) cycles.

Further help can be seen in the script:
